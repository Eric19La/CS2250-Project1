            <h1>Getting to Know Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a computer science student with a passion for web development and technology.
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new recipes in the kitchen or hiking local trails.</p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I grew up in a small town where I developed my love for both technology and cooking.
            My grandmother taught me the importance of good food and bringing people together around the dinner table.</p>

            <p>Currently, I'm studying computer science and working on various web development projects.
            I believe technology should be accessible and useful for everyone.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Book</h2>
            <p>One book I've read multiple times is "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams.
            Its humor and wit never get old, and it perfectly captures the absurdity of life and the universe.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>Why I Love This Book</summary>
                <p>The book combines science fiction with brilliant British humor. Adams has a way of making
                the impossible seem mundane and the mundane seem extraordinary. It's a book that works on
                multiple levels - as entertainment, philosophy, and social commentary.</p>
